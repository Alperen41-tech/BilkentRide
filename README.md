An Android application being developed by Furkan Karademir and me as a personal project
(Written in Java using Android Studio).
Our purpose was to solve one of the most frequent problems that people face daily:
Transportation.
The application collects information about users' locations and whether they are offering a ride or
seeking one. It then matches users based on their current location and destination, eliminating
the need for buses or taxis and saving time.
